#Instructions:

Implement a simple web application to display a user-entered color. 

##There should be at least two visible items on the page

### [X] An input box

### [X] A div with a border (so you know it's there even when the color is the same as the page color). 

  #### The div should show whatever color the user supplies in the input dynamically ("purple", "#0f0", "#fff000", etc.). 

1) Always display the latest valid color 
1) Pressing enter in the input box should have no effect.
1) The input box should initially prompt the user with something like "Enter a color or code".
1) Feel free to extend the application any way you see fit, or talk about potential extensions.
1) Use a modern Javascript MV* library like React, Backbone, Ember, Angular, etc.

##Features


##try-it-out feature: in addition to making the page change when the color field is filled in, make it change briefly on-hover to 
### one of 9 selections in a grid, or 
### one of 100 selections on a color wheel.

##Embedded Routing feature
### create a "<" and ">" link to advance through different input options below the original div box.
### 

##Technical Tweaks


###Make sure it works on IE8 and FF3.6 (Since Bootstrap dropped support for these.)
