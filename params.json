[X] Div with a border (so you know it's there even when the color is the same as the page color). <em>Added dotted border line</em>\r\n1. [X] The div shows whatever color the user supplies in the input dynamically (\"purple\", \"#0f0\", \"#fff000\", etc.). \r\n1. [X] Always display the latest valid color \r\n1. [X] Pressing enter in the input box should have no effect.\r\n1. [X] The input box should initially prompt the user with something like \"Enter a color or code\".\r\n1. [X] Feel free to extend the application any way you see fit, or talk about potential extensions.\r\n1. [X] Use a modern Javascript MV* library like React, Backbone, Ember, Angular, etc. <em> used Angular</em>\r\n\r\n## Feature Extensions!\r\n\r\n1. On-Hover color selection: This will replace the current text input field. User's cursor changes the background color on-hover over one of 'n' selections in a color wheel! \r\n1. Portal of Inspiration: User's color selection results in display of open-source images in given hue (see: http://labs.tineye.com/multicolr/#colors=638fc3;weights=100;) through an embedded viewport. \r\n1. Embedded Routing: Users will click \"<\" and \">\" links to advance through alternative input options (vice filling in the code or color) - grid of color names, hex values.\r\n1. Drag-and-drop: User can drag and drop color selections for different parts of the page (eg. first quote block becomes one color, next quote is another).  \r\n1. Gamification: Continuous runner where user jumps to select desired color. \r\n\r\n## Technical Tweaks\r\n\r\n1. Factor lines of Angular.js into an app.js file before adding new Angular features.\r\n1. Factor all custom CSS out of index.htmls and into custom.css file\r\n1. Verify functionality in IE 8 and Firefox 3.6, since Bootstrap has dropped support for these. If not responsive, polyfill.\r\n\r\n## Design Tweaks\r\n\r\n1. Add a color transition delay (fade-in/out) for smoothness of experience.\r\n1. Update Favicon from paintbrush/palette to color wheel or other modern design.\r\n1. Consider making some unicorns jump across the screen for Pete's sake. They do love rainbows.\r\n",
